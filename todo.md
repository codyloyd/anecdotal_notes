## todo:
- student controller is a MESSSSSSS
  - figure out how to properly implement the filters.. they're so HACK-y at the moment... and could REALLY use some refactoring.
- figure out pdf export issue..
  - it's functional, but for some reason on heroku the styling isn't working as expected.
  - also: i'm not sure it works in conjunction with the filters.

- figure out timezone thing!
- implement devise confirmation emails
- investigate omniauth for google sign-in
- paginate notes
- add notes for classes
- allow classes to be archived (still accessible, but not on the front-page, and in a separate list on the user's profile)
- add links to GOTO student
- add new note form to student page
- investigate Ajax solution for selecting class lists on home page
