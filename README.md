# Anecdotal Notes

The basic goal of this webapp is to keep a database of students and to allow the teacher to add anecdotal and observational notes to the kids quickly and easily by typing the notes into their phone, tablet or computer.

the app is for teachers to _quickly_ jot down notes that they can associate with students in their classroom.  Teachers can then later review the notes, ordered by student/timestamp/context (i.e. reading time/recess etc.).  Teachers should be able to sort/edit notes and then print reports that they can share with administrators or parents.
